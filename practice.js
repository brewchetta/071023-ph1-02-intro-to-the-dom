// // PAIR PROGRAMMING PRACTICE // //
// wait until groups have been assigned before you attempt these challenges!
// fork and clone this repo and follow the instructions in this file


// // GETTING STARTED // //
// To get started, add this line of code to the index.html somewhere in the <head> tag:
// <script defer src="practice.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
// this will allow you to write in this file and see changes on the DOM

// create a new div with an id of .movie-posters and append it to the body

// do this three times:

// find a movie poster you like and add it as an <img> inside the .movie-poster div

// beneath each <img> add the movie title as an <h2>

// further refine the movie posters:
// each movie poster gets its own <div> which includes the poster <img>, the title <h2>
// and a short description <p>

// once you have the movie posters can you...

// console.log the title and description for the first movie poster?

// change the <img> src, title text, and description text for the second movie poster?

// delete the last movie poster?



// // HINTS // //

// given that adding movie posters is a repetetive task, it may be easier to build
// a function that takes in certain arguments and does the work for you...

// remember that you need a few steps in order to finally see a dom element on the page:
// create the element
// change attributes like text or src
// append the element
